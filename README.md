### Key Insights 

* Many of the teams perform better online becasue when you are playing online/qualifiers you are guarenteed to play a certain amount of games which is usually five which guarantee wins. Where in LAN you are not guarantee anything because many of the times games are you either win or you are out. That can be why we have many of the top teams with higher online win pct then there majors. However that does not go with many of the other teams , many of these teams players just perform better on LAN then Online.

* Teams like Los Angeles Guerrillas and Seattle Surge who have been around since 2021 have both prefered playing on LAN and have won many of there series on LAN. With both franchises winning in the 2022 season.

* Toronto Ultra and Los Angles Thieves are teams that are split between LAN and Online.

* With the Miami Herectics 2024 season being there first, have an upside of just performing online a lot better then LAN.
