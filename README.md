### Key Insights 

* Many of the teams perform better online becasue when you are playing online/qualifiers you are guarenteed to play a certain amount of games which is usually five which guarantee wins. Where in LAN you are not guarantee anything because many of the times games are you either win or you are out. That can be why we have many of the top teams with higher online win pct then there majors. However that does not go with many of the other teams , many of these teams players just perform better on LAN then Online.

* Teams like Los Angeles Guerrillas and Seattle Surge who have been around since 2021 have both prefered playing on LAN and have won many of there series on LAN. With both franchises winning in the 2022 season.

* Toronto Ultra and Los Angles Thieves are teams that are split between LAN and Online.

* With the Miami Herectics 2024 season being there first, have an upside of just performing online a lot better then LAN.

In this image we can point out some key statistics that shows the average points, the amount of wins each of these 8th places teams get and a lot more that can help us understand what criterias you need to fullfill in order to get into the biggest COD tournamnet of the year.


### Key Insights 

* Average Points = 186.25
  - Looking into the average points you would want at least 160 points as the min for all teams was 160 and your goal would be 210 since that is what the highest value was.

* Total Series Averages , Wins = 16 , Losses = 19
  - Looking into these values you would want to win about 17 games as that is the max and not lose more than 22 games as that will have you disqualified

* describe analysis
  - When analyzing the 8th place teams you can see that the majority of them get there wins from online play
  - Meaning if your team can get consistently high placings on LAN and get points from both online play and LAN they should be in good spots because all 4 teams that have been in this position did not do that which can lead to you being in this posistion

* Majors vs Online Win percentages
